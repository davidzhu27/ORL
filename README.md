## Installation

1. Set up and install the d4rl environments by following the instructions provided in the d4rl documentation until you can successfully run `import d4rl` in your Python environment.

2. Clone the GitHub repository into a folder named 'CORL' using the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git CORL

    Replace `username/repository.git` with the actual URL of the GitHub repository you want to clone.
